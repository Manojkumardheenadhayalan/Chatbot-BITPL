Put some ice in a kitchen towel and place it on your foot for about 30 minutes. Compression Using a compression sleeve, elastic bandage wrap or brace on the affected ankle can prevent excessive swelling, protect the area from repeated injuries and provide support. Some inflammation is needed for healing, but too much can be harmful. Elevation The early treatment for an ankle sprain is the \"RICE\" method of treatment. This is focused on reducing swelling and reducing pain: Rest: The first 24 to 48 hours after the injury is considered a critical treatment period.
