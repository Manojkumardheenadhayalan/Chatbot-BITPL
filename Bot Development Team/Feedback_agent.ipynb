Advantages of Linear Search: Linear search can be used irrespective of whether the array is sorted or not. It can be used on arrays of any data type. Does not require any additional memory. It is a well-suited algorithm for small datasets. Best Case Complexity - In Linear search, best case occurs when the element we are finding is at the first position of the array. The best-case time complexity of linear search is O(1).; Average Case Complexity - The average case time complexity of linear search is O(n). Worst Case Complexity - In Linear search, the worst case occurs when the element we are looking is present at the end of the ... The linear search algorithm has the following applications: Linear search can be applied to both single-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.
